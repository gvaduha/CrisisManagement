Assumptions about requirements
------------------------------
- Crisis is relatively rare event
- Every crisis is more or less geographically local
- Crisis involves only part of multinational company and by locality of the crisis this couldn't be very a big number (suppose less than 100K even for organization with enormous size)
- Crisis event could involve only current employees and their family members. So we suppose "static view" at the time of the event (this could be of no importance)
- Define "virtual room" as a place where team members store and share different artifacts
- Virtual room contain documents that have different format and purpose
- Company owns Windows based servers as they wants to use MS .NET
- Company decided to implement the System with less possible 3rd party components especially non-free
- Company decided to deploy the System using own infrastructure and software
